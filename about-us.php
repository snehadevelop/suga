                        <h3>WSGD-LP SUGA 95.7 FM, LEHIGH ACRES, FLORIDA</h3>
                        <h6>On November 12, 1996 Sumarrase, Inc., the parent organization for our station, WSGD-LP Suga 95.7 FM, was registered in Miami Dade, Florida, to receive a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license to operate a radio station. Four years later in 2000, while still waiting for the FCC to release their waitlist window, which would allow us to license our radio station, the commission established the new low power FM radio station format. In 2006, while continuing to wait for the FCC to open their window, SUGA 104.5 FM, which was our original station, relocated to Lehigh Acres in Southwest Florida. On June 17, 2013, the FCC announced that their application window would open from October 15, 2013, to October 29, 2013. This led to Sumarrase Inc. applying for a local low power FM radio station for Lehigh Acres, Florida. However, it was not until February 9, 2015,that Sumarrase Inc. got the approval to operate the low power FM station, WSGD-LP Suga 95.7 FM in Lehigh Acres, Southwest Florida. Two months later, on April 20, 2015, the station, which was designated as a nonprofit company, was established as Sumarrase, Inc., DBA SUGA 95.7 FM</h6>
